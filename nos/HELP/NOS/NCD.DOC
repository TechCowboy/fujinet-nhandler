NCD - Mount or unmount network drive.

Mount or unmount a remote directory
to a network device (N1: thru N4:).
The remote directory must be hosted
using one of the supported FujiNet
protocols.

Mounting
--------
To register a N: device drive spec
with a network resource, type NCD (or
CD) followed by a URL.

Usage:

NCD|CD [N[n]:]proto://host[:port][/path][/]

Where n is an optional device number
1-4. If n is omitted, the current
default device number is implied.

Where proto is a network protocol,
such as TNFS, FTP, SMB.

Where host is the hostname or IP
address providing the service for
proto.

Where port is an optional network
port number for cases where a server
is listening on a non-standard port.

For example, port 80 is standard for
HTTP, but a server might be
configured to listen on port 8000.

General examples:

NCD TNFS://192.168.1.100/
NCD N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100
NCD N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/action/myproj/
NCD N2:FTP://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/collections/
NCD "N2:FTP://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/collections/holmes cd/"
NCD N3:HTTP://hobbs:8000/

A trailing path separator is appended
if one is not provided.

Example:

NCD N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/myproj

resolves to:

NCD N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/myproj/

After establishing a mount point
using a protocol and absolute path,
a subsequent relative path can be
supplied.

Example:

NCD N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/
NCD action/myproj

results in the path:

N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/action/myproj/

There is limited support for supp-
lying a relative path that includes a
reference to a parent directory.

Example:

NCD
N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/action/myproj01/
NCD ../myproj02/

results in the path:

N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/action/myproj01/../myproj02/

Unmounting
----------
To release a remote mount point,
enter the NCD command with only a
device and no protocol and path.

Usage:

NCD|CD N[n]:

Where n is an optional device number
1-4. If n is omitted, the current
default device number is implied.

Example:

NCD N2:
CD N1:
