NPWD - Query the current mount point
for a network drive from the FujiNet
device and display the results.

Usage:

NPWD|PWD [N[n]:]

Where Nn: is optional and n detotes a
device number 1-8. If n is omitted,
the current default device number is
implied.

Examples:

NPWD
N1:TNFS://192.168.1.100/myproj01/

NPWD N2:
N2:FTP://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/

PWD N2:
N2:FTP://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/

In the examples, the line following
the NPWD|PWD command is the response
from the FujiNet device.

If there is nothing mounted to on the
N: device then the response will be
blank.
