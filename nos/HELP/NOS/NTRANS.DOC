NTRANS - Translate the end-of-line
character when transferring text data
between a remote host's operating
system and the ATARI computer.

Usage:

NTRANS [N[n]:] 0|1|2|3

Examples:
NTRANS
NTRANS 3
NTRANS N1: 0

The ATARI's native end-of-line char-
actor is $9B. Windows uses CRLF ($0D,
$0A) and Unix (Linux, Mac OS) uses 
newline ($0A).

Mode Description      Host <--> ATARI
---- -----------      ---------------
0    No translation    $9B <--> $9B
1    Carriage Return   $0D <--> $9B
2    Newline           $0A <--> $9B
3    CRLF          $0D,$0A <--> $9B

FujiNet firmware versions after
2023-07-04 enable bi-directional
translation for all modes.

Beware that having EOL translation
enabled may corrupt binary data. One
suggestion is to mount an N: device 
dedicated for accessing text 
documents. Nothing prevents two N: 
devices from pointing to the same
mount point. So one could be used to
launch programs and the other to load
and save text documents.
