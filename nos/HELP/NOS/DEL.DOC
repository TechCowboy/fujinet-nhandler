DEL - Delete a file found on a mount
point.

Usage:

	DEL|ERASE [N[n]]:[path/]file

Only one file can be deleted per
command. Pattern-matching using
wildcard characters is not currently
supported.

Filenames are case-sensitive. If a
filename contains spaces, enclose the
entire path and filename with
double-quotes.

Examples:

DEL MYFILE.AWP
DEL N2:MyFile.AWP
DEL N2:DOCS/MYFILE.AWP
DEL "N2:DOCS/My File.AWP"
ERASE "N2:DOCS/My File.AWP"
