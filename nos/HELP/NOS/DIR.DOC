DIR - Display a list of files/direct-
ories found on a mounted network 
drive. Filename and file size are 
returned.

Usage:

DIR [N[n]:][path/][pattern]

Where Nn: is optional and n detotes a
device number 1-4. If n is omitted,
the current default device number is
implied.

Where path is a relative path from
the current working directory.

Where pattern is optional and can
include a pattern string including
wildcard characters [*].

Examples:

DIR
DIR *.BAS
DIR N:
DIR N2:
DIR N2:*.BAS
DIR N2:action/HELLO*.ACT
DIR "N2:holmes cd/"
DIR TNFS://localhost/

Notes:

1. Regardless of the pattern string,
directory entries are always 
returned.

2. A trailing slash '/' is required 
to display the contents of a
sub-directory rather than the
directory name itself.

3. For long listings:

Key             Purpose
---             -------
SPACE           Pause
Non-SPACE Key   Resume
ESC             Quit
CTRL+1          Pause/Resume
