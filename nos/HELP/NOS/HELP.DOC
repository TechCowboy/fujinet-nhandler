FujiNet NOS Online Help System

Usage:

HELP [TOPIC][/SUBTOPIC]

The HELP system displays text
documents stored on Github. There-
fore, the help system is unavailable
if the FujiNet has no access to the
Internet.

Issuing the HELP command by itself
will display a list of general
topics.

Typing HELP TOPIC (where "TOPIC" is
an item in the list of topics) will
show more detail and possibly a list
of subtopics.

Finally, typing HELP TOPIC/SUBTOPIC
will show the most detail on a spec-
ific item.

If a document is larger than one
screen, the text stream will pause.
Press any key to resume the text 
stream.

Press ESC to exit scrolling text.
