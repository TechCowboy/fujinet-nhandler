BASIC - Enable/disable BASIC-in-ROM

Usage:

BASIC [ON OFF]
or
ROM [ON OFF]

The BASIC command is used to swap
the 8K address space at $A000-$BFFF
between RAM and ROM on the ATARI
XL/XE machines (excluding the
1200XL). This allows you to switch
from working in BASIC to, say,
loading a machine-language game
without having to restart the
computer while holding the OPTION
console switch.

This command also works for computers
with upgrades like the Ultimate 1MB
or Incognito, where alternative ROMs
can be selected in place of ATARI
BASIC. Therefore, the alias
ROM [ONOFF] exists in case it seems
more sensible to use it instead.

As a hopefully helpful reminder, when
$A000-$BFFF is pointing to ROM, the
border color (register COLOR4) will
be set to gray while in the NOS
command processor. The border color
will revert to its previous state
when the session is returned to BASIC
using the CAR command or when BASIC
is disabled.

If BASIC ON or ROM ON is executed
when the address space is already
pointing to ROM, the command will
instead perform the CAR command.
This avoids a warm start.

Example:

BASIC ON
BASIC OFF
ROM ON
ROM OFF
